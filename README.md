# DA-DS-Journey

With my knowledge of python, I decided to start learning one of python's library called NumPy which stands for Numerial Python used for working on numerical data in python.

Included in this repo are the things i learnt which includes:
a) creating a one dimensional array.
b) Creating a multidimensional array.
c) Looked at various methods like: size, shape, reshape, arange, linspace, eye, zeros, ones etc.
d) Generating random values. 
e) Indexing and slicing
f) Making a copy of original data
g) Broadcasting
h) Creating matrix


After this i would begin learning another of pythons library called pandas and finally put them into use.
